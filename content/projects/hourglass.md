## Countdown app

<a class="google-play" href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tmg.hourglass'><img width="200" alt='Get it on Google Play' src='/img/google-play.png'/></a> 

HourGlass is a small app to be able to:

- countdown to an event
- track something between two dates so you know what the value _should_ be. 

You can use this to track how much you should have saved towards a holiday, or how many miles a rental car should be on when you drop it off if you have a quota
